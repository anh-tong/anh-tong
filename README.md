- 👋 Hi, I’m @anh-tong
- 👀 I’m interested in Probabilistic Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics (i.e., Gaussian Process)
- 📖 My research highlights include some new methods for Automatic Statistician applying to multiple relational data settings, and new perspective of analyzing deep Gaussian processes
- 🌱 Recently, I've working some ideas related to second-order optimization method including implicit gradient to solve various problems, 
i.e. bilevel optimization, hyperparameter optimization, and more.
